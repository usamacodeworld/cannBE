## Usage Examples

### Creating a Shipping Zone

```typescript
// Create a zone for the United States
const zoneData = {
  name: "United States",
  slug: "us",
  description: "Shipping zone for the United States",
  zoneType: "country",
  countries: ["US"],
  isActive: true,
  priority: 1
};

const zone = await shippingZoneService.create(zoneData);
```

### Creating a Shipping Method

```typescript
// Create a standard shipping method
const methodData = {
  name: "Standard Shipping",
  slug: "standard-shipping",
  description: "Standard ground shipping",
  methodType: "flat_rate",
  carrierType: "standard",
  zoneId: zoneId,
  estimatedDays: 5,
  isActive: true,
  priority: 1
};

const method = await shippingMethodService.create(methodData);
```

### Creating a Shipping Rate

```typescript
// Create a flat rate shipping
const rateData = {
  methodId: methodId,
  rateType: "flat_rate",
  baseRate: 9.99,
  additionalRate: 0,
  isActive: true,
  priority: 1,
  handlingFee: 2.00,
  insuranceFee: 0,
  signatureFee: 0
};

const rate = await shippingRateService.create(rateData);
```

### Creating an Item-Based Shipping Rate

```typescript
// Create an item-based shipping rate
// First 3 items: $5.99, each additional item: $1.50
const itemBasedRateData = {
  methodId: methodId,
  rateType: "item_based",
  baseRate: 5.99, // Rate for first few items
  firstItemCount: 3, // Number of items included in base rate
  additionalItemRate: 1.50, // Rate per additional item
  maxItems: 20, // Maximum items for this rate (optional)
  maxShippingCost: 25.00, // Maximum shipping cost cap (optional)
  isActive: true,
  priority: 1,
  handlingFee: 1.00,
  insuranceFee: 0,
  signatureFee: 0
};

const itemBasedRate = await shippingRateService.create(itemBasedRateData);
```

### Calculating Shipping Cost

```typescript
// Calculate shipping cost
const calculationParams = {
  methodId: methodId,
  weight: 2.5, // kg
  orderValue: 150.00, // USD
  itemCount: 5, // Number of items in the order
  productIds: ["product1", "product2"],
  categoryIds: ["electronics"],
  isHoliday: false
};

const result = await shippingRateService.calculateShippingCost(calculationParams);

if (result) {
  console.log(`Shipping cost: $${result.totalCost}`);
  console.log(`Breakdown:`, result.breakdown);
}
```

## Rate Calculation Logic

The shipping rate calculation follows this priority order:

1. **Zone Matching**: Find the appropriate shipping zone for the address
2. **Method Selection**: Get available shipping methods for the zone
3. **Rate Matching**: Find the best matching rate based on:
   - Product/category inclusion/exclusion
   - Weight, price, or distance ranges
   - Time validity (current date within validFrom/validTo)
   - Holiday rates
   - Priority scores
4. **Cost Calculation**: Calculate total cost including:
   - Base rate
   - Additional costs based on rate type
   - Handling, insurance, and signature fees

## Rate Types

### Flat Rate
- Fixed cost regardless of weight, price, or distance
- Example: $9.99 for any order

### Weight-Based
- Base rate + additional cost per weight unit
- Example: $5.00 base + $1.00 per kg

### Price-Based
- Base rate + percentage of order value
- Example: $3.00 base + 5% of order value

### Distance-Based
- Base rate + additional cost per distance unit
- Example: $2.00 base + $0.50 per km

### Free Shipping
- Free when order value meets threshold
- Example: Free shipping on orders over $50

### Item-Based
- Fixed rate for first few items + additional cost per item
- Example: First 3 items $5.99, each additional item $1.50
- Supports maximum item count and shipping cost caps

## Integration with Checkout

The shipping module integrates with the checkout process by:

1. **Zone Detection**: Automatically detect shipping zone based on customer address
2. **Method Selection**: Present available shipping methods to customer
3. **Cost Calculation**: Calculate shipping costs in real-time
4. **Order Integration**: Store selected shipping method and cost in order

## Permissions

The shipping module uses the following permissions:
- `MANAGE_SHIPPING`: Full access to shipping management
- `PROCESS_SHIPPING`: Process shipping orders
- `TRACK_SHIPPING`: Track shipping status

## Migration

Run the migration to create the shipping tables:

```bash
yarn migration:run
```

This will create:
- `shipping_zones` table
- `shipping_methods` table
- `shipping_rates` table
- Required indexes and foreign key constraints
- Enum types for zone, method, carrier, and rate types

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Carrier Integration**: Integrate with shipping carriers for real-time rates
- **Bulk Rate Import**: Import shipping rates from CSV/Excel files
- **Advanced Analytics**: Shipping cost analytics and reporting
- **Multi-currency Support**: Support for multiple currencies
- **Warehouse Management**: Multi-warehouse shipping calculations
- **International Shipping**: Enhanced international shipping support
